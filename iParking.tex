\begin{abstract}
By the popularization of cars, number of vehicles owned by each person
grows with passing days. However, the number of parking areas is out of
proportion. In order to satisfy the requirements of parking space and
reduce illegal parking, we propose iParking, a real-time parking space
monitoring and guiding system, in this paper. 

We lay emphasis on roadside parking. The system determines and records
empty parking spaces through cloud computing, wireless technology
between vehicles and image analysis. It tells you the nearest location
of empty parking space while drivers have requests. We expect the system
to cause attention to more people and government, and to solve relative
problems about parking space.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

\subsection{Research motivation}
%
According to statistics, the amount of vehicles increases yearly in
Taiwan. People usually create chaos near parking space while taking
plenty of time to find it. That is to say, parking problem has become
people's harassment. It is shown from statistical data in Ministry of
Transportation, Taiwan that the number of registered vehicles is
7,554,319 until December 2014 \cite{mich:tar}; However, it is also mentioned that
the number of legal parking space is about four million in total. We can say that
parking space is in short supply with the disparity of vehicles.
Moreover, it will cause several problems such as the extremely slow
speed while finding parking space, scrambling for roads with scooters,
parking temporarily in dangerous part, or driving U-turn illegally. The
behavior will not only break the safety and regular of transportation
but also make noise and consume resource.

Take Tainan City, Taiwan for example [2], high road trip rate gives rise
to high parking demand in many areas in Tainan. Up to now, there are
totally about 580 thousand registered cars and trucks while around
11,000 parking spaces are planned. Furthermore, due to the unreasonable
proportion of parking spaces (including roadside parking, off-street
parking, and spaces attached in building), roadside parking space is not
enough obviously. Theoretically, the number of roadside parking space is
required to reach 20 percent. Otherwise, it will result in lack of
parking space, spending too much time finding space, or etc.

It is easy to observe that some vehicles need to find parking space by
themselves while roadside parking spaces are not enough. The situation
will bring out arbitrary parking, and it is also the main reason of
illegal parking. In addition, according to Pollster online market survey
[3], around sixty percent of people are bothered by parking issue. Thus,
we build this application in order to provide nearby parking space
information to drivers immediately and reduce traffic problems.

Recently, LBS (Location-Based Service) [4] is getting noticed along with
the appearance of smartphones. LBS can apply broadly to different area
like health, job, daily life, and etc. Thus, how to use LBS to help
different users find the appropriate parking space is vital. The usage
of monitoring parking space now is to provide roadside parking space's
locations at best, but it will not tell drivers where the vacant space
is. Thus, we would like to develop a monitor and guiding system focus on
roadside parking to provide the information of nearby parking space and
help drivers park with the fastest way.
